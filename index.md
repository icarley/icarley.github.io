I am an evolutionary ecologist interested in how species-environment interactions drive patterns of biodiversity across scales, from alleles and genes to species and communities.<br />
As I pursue these interests, I find great joy in teaching and mentoring junior scientists. I am committed to helping make STEM, and higher education more broadly, more [equitable, inclusive, and anti-racist](https://sites.duke.edu/biodiversity/) places.<br />
<br />

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Minnesota, working with [Dave Moeller](https://moellerlab.wordpress.com/) and [Yaniv Brandvain](https://brandvainlab.wordpress.com/).<br />
I completed my PhD in 2020 at [Duke University](https://ecology.duke.edu/), where I was co-advised by [Tom Mitchell-Olds](https://sites.duke.edu/tmolab/) and [Bill Morris](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/wfmorris).
