I am an evolutionary ecologist interested in how species-environment interactions drive patterns of biodiversity across scales, from alleles and genes to species and communities. I also find great joy in teaching and mentoring junior scientists. In all of these pursuits, I am committed to helping make STEM, and higher education more broadly, more [equitable, inclusive, and anti-racist](https://sites.duke.edu/biodiversity/).<br />
<br />
Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Minnesota, working with [Dave Moeller](https://moellerlab.wordpress.com/) and [Yaniv Brandvain](https://brandvainlab.wordpress.com/). I completed my PhD in 2020 at [Duke University](https://ecology.duke.edu/), where I was co-advised by [Tom Mitchell-Olds](https://sites.duke.edu/tmolab/) and [Bill Morris](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/wfmorris).<br />
<br />
<b> News! </b> I am excited to [announce](https://ecologyandevolution.uchicago.edu/news/carley-lab) that in September 2024 I will be starting as an assistant professor in the [Department of Ecology & Evolution](https://ecologyandevolution.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago. I am currently recruiting at all levels -- PhD student(s), postdoc(s), and a full-time research assistant/lab manager. Please be in touch if you are interested in joining the lab, or even just curious about the possibility! I am really looking forward to connecting with and learning from new people and projects as the research group gets up and running.
